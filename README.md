R code for the paper Livingstone and Zanella (2019) "On the robustness of gradient-based MCMC"

The file "functions.R" contains the functions implementing the MCMC algorithm under comparison in the simulation study of the paper (namely Random Walk, MALA and the Barker scheme).

The other files allow to reproduce the simulations and plots reported in the paper.
